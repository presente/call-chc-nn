  <li>Iâ€™m calling because our communities need you to stand with the president on the issue of net neutrality.</li>
  <li>A diverse and open Internet gives all individuals and businesses an equal chance online, and is fueling a new civil rights movement.</li>
  <li>Everyone who cares about justice and the power of self-determination should stand on the side of communities, not corporations, in the fight for an open Internet.</li>
  <li>Please support the Federal Communications Commission in implementing strong net neutrality rules under Title II of the Telecommunications Act.</li>
